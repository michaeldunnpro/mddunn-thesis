	abstract = {This book, which has evolved from the author’s lectures at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Southern Denmark, draws on his experience as an active researcher in the interaction of charged particles with matter over more than forty years. The emphasis is on the theoretical description of fundamental phenomena, and much attention has been given to classic topics such as: Rutherford scattering; the theory of particle stopping as developed by Bohr, Bethe, Bloch and Lindhard; the statistical description of energy loss as developed by Bohr, Bothe, Williams and Landau; and numerous more recent developments. An attempt has been made to provide at least one complete derivation of a theoretical description for all central aspects. The presentation is intended to respect the ideas of the original authors, but much effort has been invested in establishing a unified and appealing notation consistent with present-day standards. It is intended that this volume will satisfy a long-standing need for a textbook suitable for introductory courses on interactions of charged particles with matter for students of physics, chemistry and related fields at the graduate and postgraduate level. In order to make it useful for researchers in materials science, electrical engineering, medical technique and other application areas in science and engineering, a large number of appendices has been added with background material that should be familiar to physicists but not necessarily to others. Chapters 1-5 are predominantly tutorial, while chapters 6-9 develop topics leading to the frontiers of research.},

	abstract = {The binary collision approximation (BCA) has long been used in computer simulations of the interactions of energetic atoms with solid targets, as well as being the basis of most analytical theory in this area. While mainly a high-energy approximation, the BCA retains qualitative significance at low energies and, with proper formulation, gives useful quantitative information as well. Moreover, computer simulations based on the BCA can achieve good statistics in many situations where those based on full classical dynamical models require the most advanced computer hardware or are even impracticable. The foundations of the BCA in classical scattering are reviewed, including methods of evaluating the scattering integrals, interaction potentials, and electron excitation effects. The explicit evaluation of time at significant points on particle trajectories is discussed, as are scheduling algorithms for ordering the collisions in a developing cascade. An approximate treatment of nearly simultaneous collisions is outlined and the searching algorithms used in MARLOWE are presented},

	abstract = {Neutron detection is nowadays mostly based on 3He gas detectors, but its shortage and the continuous upgrades of the neutron facilities require new devices to perform experiments with maximum performances. This work presents a new detector based on the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) combined with several boron layers. This detector combines the features of GEM technology with the properties of boron as a neutron converter and the device is produced to sustain high neutron fluxes with high detection efficiency. The detector has been characterised at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source (UK). Based on the analysis of our results, the detector has shown a good response to thermal and epithermal neutrons reaching a detection efficiency of 16\% at 1.8 Å (25 meV). The good detection efficiency (even increasable with the addition of further boron GEM foils) and the good time resolution, make the detector a unique device for the neutron techniques. In particular, its use can easily be envisaged in techniques involving neutron transmission measurements, that require high fluxes impinging on the detectors, with the added bonus of a 2D-resolved capability due to the padded anode.},

Herein, proton-projected ranges and defect distributions in the (010) plane (Y-normal plane) of microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD)-grown diamond irradiated with 0.5–2.0 MeV proton (H+ or molecular H2+ ions) in a nonchanneling (near [001], Z-axis) direction, are experimentally measured via cross-sectional optical microscopy and high-resolution confocal Raman spectroscopy mapping. It is found that the projected ranges of the experimental findings and the simulation results indicate good consistencies, whereas there is considerable disagreement between them in regards to longitudinal straggling and lateral straggling. Based on the comparisons and analyses, a clear view of protons implanted in single crystalline diamond in the high-energy range theoretically and experimentally is obtained.},

Relevant k\{sub 0\}-definitions for different activation decay schemes are summarised and upgraded to cases of extremely high fluxes. The main standardisation techniques for INAA are discussed, emphasizing the k\{sub 0\}-standardisation. Some general aspects of the basic equipment and its calibration are discussed, such as the characterisation of the neutron field and the tuning of the spectrometry part.

We formed diamond pn diodes with ideal electric properties. A large built-in bias of 4.7 eV was obtained. The diode represented less than 10−11 A of low leakage current up to nearly 1 MV/cm of a high electric field.

	abstract = {Alpha-voltaic cells have great potential in military, biomedical, and infrastructure applications due to their characteristics of long operating life, small volume, and superior adaptability. However, improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE), and the balance between power density and stability have been a challenge owing to the ‘poor-matching’ between energy conversion transducers and alpha-emitting isotope sources, as well as the radiation damage to semiconductor devices. In this study, we report the electrical properties of a high-performance alpha-voltaic cell based on a 4H-SiC PIN junction diode energy conversion transducer (active area of 1 cm2) that has been experimentally validated by a He ions electrostatic accelerator. Remarkably, the alpha-voltaic cell displayed an excellent PCE of 0.88\%, exhibiting a nearly 7-fold enhancement compared to alpha-voltaic cells of previous studies, with a strikingly high open-circuit voltage of 1.99 V, a short-circuit current of 13.64 nA/cm2, and a maximum output power density of 16.78 nW/cm2.},

	abstract = {Radiation damage is a significant concern with both alphavoltaic and betavoltaic cells because their performance degrades, especially with high-energy - ({\textgreater}200keV) beta and alpha particles. Indirect excitation methods, such as the Photon Intermediate Direct Energy Conversion (PIDEC) framework, can protect the transducer from radiation. A nuclear battery using a 90Sr beta source was constructed by the author's research group, which demonstrated the radiation resistance of a PIDEC cell driven by beta particles (PIDECβ cell). Use of alpha sources to drive nuclear batteries would appear to be much more attractive than beta sources due to higher potential power density. However, they are also subject to higher rates of radiation damage. This paper describes the successful incorporation of alpha particles into the PIDEC framework using the alpha emitter 210Po to form a PIDECα cell.

The thickness and surface uniformity of the target were checked by two independent techniques before ion beam irradiation. The stopping power of diamond was evaluated from these data and compared with SRIM Monte Carlo simulations of ion transport, showing a slight overestimate of the simulated values over the experimental stopping powers. In addition, a comparison was made with theoretical calculations based on the Bethe formula to extract the mean ionization potential, I, of carbon atoms in diamond. The obtained I-value was 81 ± 4 eV. A discussion and comparison with results of other authors is given.},

	abstract = {The globally increased demand for helium-3 along with the limited availability of this gas calls for the development of alternative technologies for the large ESS instrumentation pool. We report on the CASCADE Project - a novel detection system, which has been developed for the purposes of neutron spin echo spectroscopy. It features 2D spatially resolved detection of thermal neutrons at high rates. The CASCADE detector is composed of a stack of solid 10B coated Gas Electron Multiplier foils, which serve both as a neutron converter and as an amplifier for the primary ionization deposited in the standard Argon-CO2 counting gas environment. This multi-layer setup efficiently increases the detection efficiency and serves as a helium-3 alternative. It has furthermore been possible to extract the signal of the charge traversing the stack to identify the very thin conversion layer of about 1 micrometer. This allows the precise determination of the time-of-flight, necessary for the application in MIEZE spin echo techniques.},

The ratio of channelled to random stopping is found to be the same for all three ions at the same velocity. The ratio of the stopping power at the leading edge of the channelled peak to random, taken as a measure of the ratio for best-channelled particles is found to be 0.64±0.02 for the 〈110〉 axis for 12 MeV protons. The results are compared with several recent theories of channelled energy loss and are found to lie between the predictions of Dettmann and Esbensen and Golovchenko. A theoretical approach using a spatially periodic dielectric function is found to give results close to those of Esbensen and Golovchenko.},

The approximation generally reproduces the Vavilov most probable energy loss and full width at half maximum to better than 1\% and 10\%, respectively, with signiﬁcantly better agreement as Vavilov’s j approaches 1.},
