# What is this?
This is a repository containing code and data written for my Spring 2026 undergraduate thesis at Reed College. It contains a 
makefile and several (some still in progress) Jupyter notebooks. I have additionally created my own Python bindings based on 
RustBCA's templates.
## How do I run this code?
You'll need to have Cargo and Python>=3.9 installed on a Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS, WSL2). 
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `make` to build the Rust library and install the Python bindings.
3. You can then run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to reproduce the results and figures in my thesis. Each notebook is self-contained and includes instructions on how to run it.
4. Once you're running the code, wait a very long time. I'm sorry. Maybe grab a coffee?
## What is the purpose of this code?
It serves to validate the approach my thesis takes to modeling ion-solid interactions, among other things.
